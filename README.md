## PIT FIGHTER 2018
**AIDAN SMALLBONE 2018**

This is my final project for ICS3U. It is a fighting game written in C# w/ XNA 4.0 in VS 2017. Other tools used include Aseprite, Photoshop and Irfanview. Assets have been borrowed from Street Fighter 2 for the SNES, and some of the sounds have also been borrowed from SNES games, but I didn't keep track of which ones so unfortunately I cannot give proper credit.

**OTHER**

This game was made using XNA, so it cannot be played with anything other than an XBOX 360 controller connected to Windows. I plan on finishing up certain parts of the game and making the control scheme user selectable, but for now the XB360 controller is the only way to play.
