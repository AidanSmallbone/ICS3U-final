## PIT FIGHTER 2018
**AIDAN SMALLBONE 2018**

This is my final project for ICS3U. It is a fighting game written in C# w/ XNA 4.0 in VS 2017. Other tools used include Aseprite, Photoshop and Irfanview. Assets have been borrowed from Street Fighter 2 for the SNES, and some of the sounds have also been borrowed from SNES games, but I didn't keep track of which ones so unfortunately I cannot give proper credit.

**OTHER**

This game was made using XNA, so it cannot be played with anything other than an XBOX 360 controller connected to Windows. I plan on finishing up certain parts of the game and making the control scheme user selectable, but for now the XB360 controller is the only way to play.

**COMING SOON**

Turns out I have some more time to work on this project, so I plan on making it a finished game. ETA for all of this is about a month from now (early march 2018) and i've made a basic list of some of the stuff I'd like to do. The main reason I'm updating is because we are going to be building some new arcade cabinets at my school and the game needs to be updated to work with that control scheme.
